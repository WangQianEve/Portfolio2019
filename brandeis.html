So we used a “what-why-where” information hierarchy, which includes 3 levels of information: <span class="highlight brandeis-color">“what data is being requested”, “why it’s requested”, and “where is the data used”</span>. They are shown in a progressive disclosure fashion in both global settings and app settings.</p>

    <div class="section section-item">
        <div class="space-below highlight label">Reflection</div>
        <p>I learned a lot from this project, especially designing for a complex system, and applying existing design styles.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The key for designing a complex system is to simplify it through understanding the data and logic, combining an understanding of the user. We spent weeks discussing the controlling logic and the data, conducting user research to understand users' mental model before settling down on a design. </li>
            <li>I also got familiar with Material Design through this project. Applying a design style is not only about imitation, it's also about innovation. How to use the existing style to create something that fits your concept is the challenge. We often refer back to the material design website and the current Android system to seek inspiration. Android developer documentation is also crucial for us to figure out what kind of modification/customization is feasible.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This project has not ended, we are in the process of talking to more sponsors and partners. In the future, we hope to keep refining the product till it can satisfy most users and more institutional needs. One direction I'm particularly interested in is to provide smart recommendations for privacy settings so that user don't have to dive into the complex system.</p>
        <p>I hope one day, everyone is able to protect and manage their privacy easily and wisely.</p>
